## Whats new in 1.8?
 - *Mailing*
   - Now you can send credentials to any email. You just need a gmail and app password to use this feature. Edit the data in `files/email.json`
 - *Custom Preview*
   - Now you can set a custom social media preview of your link. Enter a website url when asked in `shadow url`. Your link will have same appearence as that website in whatsapp/messenger/telegram etc. Note this only works with Cloudflared urls
 - *OTP Support*
   - 20 templates will show an option to enable otp pages
 - *Saved*
   - An option to view all saved credentials just from CFPhisher. This credentials won't get deleted in CFPhisher update

## Whats new in 1.9?
 - *Loclx*
   - Introducing a new port forwarding/tunneling service named localxpose or loclx. It is quite slower but still usable
 - *Docker image*
   - A docker image is published which can be pulled and run
 - *PIP*
   - This project is now also available in PIP

## Whats new in 2.0?
 - *LocalHostRun*
   - Introducing a new port forwarding/tunneling service named localhost.run. It works over ssh without binaries
 - *Redirection url*
   - Users can decide where the victim will be redirected after data is captured

## Solution of common issues
 - Some secured browsers like Firefox can warn for '@' prefixed links. You should use pure links or custom link to avoid it.
 - Termux from play store in not supported. Download termux from fdroid or github
 - VPN or proxy prevents tunneling and even proper internet access. Turn them off you have issues.
 - Some android requires hotspot to start Cloudflared and Loclx. If you face 'tunneling failed' in android, most probably your hotspot is turned off. Turn it on and keep it on untill you close CFPhisher.
 - If you want mailing credentials then you need to use app password. Visit [here](https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/apppasswords) and generate an app password, put that in `files/email.json`. You may need to enable 2FA before it.
